I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof [Jin L.C. Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and Prof [Xue Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/). 

Before joining McGill, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and [Zhiyuan Honour Degree in Engineering](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en/about/overview) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was advised by Prof [Li Jiang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/) for my Bachelor's thesis and worked with Prof [Xiaokang Yang](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ). I also worked with Prof [Weichen Liu](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/liu/) as a visiting research student at [Nanyang Technological University(NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), who inspired me to conduct high-quality research.

I am passionate about building **Data-Centric AI**. Specificially, I am studying (i) how to model and select feature and (ii) how to provide high-quality labels for both deep learning and foundation models **fully automaticially**. I am eager to free humankind from repeatative, tedious work and enable us to focus on more creative tasks. I am actively working on its application in various domains, including advertisement, finance, and software engineering.
