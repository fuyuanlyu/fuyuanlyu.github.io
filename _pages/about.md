I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof [Jin L.C. Guo](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) and Prof [Xue Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/). 

Before joining McGill, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Zhiyuan Honour Degree in Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was advised by Prof [Li Jiang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~jiangli/) for my thesis and worked with Prof [Xiaokang Yang](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=yDEavdMAAAAJ). I also worked with Prof [Weichen Liu](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/liu/) as a visiting research student at [Nanyang Technological University(NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)
